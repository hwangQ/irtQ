#' IRT Residual-Based Differential Item Functioning (RDIF) Detection Framework
#'
#' This function computes three RDIF statistics for each item: \eqn{RDIF_{R}},
#' \eqn{RDIF_{S}}, and \eqn{RDIF_{RS}} (Lim & Choe, 2023; Lim et al., 2022).
#' \eqn{RDIF_{R}} primarily captures differences in raw residuals between two
#' groups, which are typically associated with uniform DIF. \eqn{RDIF_{S}}
#' primarily captures differences in squared residuals, which are typically
#' associated with nonuniform DIF. \eqn{RDIF_{RS}} jointly considers both types
#' of differences and is capable of detecting both uniform and nonuniform DIF.
#'
#' @inheritParams irtfit
#' @inheritParams est_score
#' @param score A numeric vector of examinees' ability estimates (theta values),
#'   in the same row order as `data`. The estimates should be based on the item
#'   parameters in `x` (see **Details**). If `NULL`, abilities are estimated
#'   internally with [irtQ::est_score()] using `method`, `range`, `norm.prior`,
#'   `nquad`, `weights`, and `ncore`. When `purify = TRUE`, abilities are
#'   re-estimated internally at every purification iteration, so a supplied
#'   `score` is used only in the initial analysis. A missing value in `score`
#'   excludes the examinee from the analysis, also during purification, with a
#'   warning. The `est_item`
#'   method has no `score` argument; it uses the abilities stored in the object.
#'   Default is `NULL`.
#' @param group A numeric or character vector indicating examinees' group
#'   membership. The length of the vector must match the number of rows in the
#'   response data matrix.
#' @param focal.name A single numeric or character value specifying the focal
#'   group. For instance, given `group = c(0, 1, 0, 1, 1)` and '1' indicating
#'   the focal group, set `focal.name = 1`.
#' @param item.skip A numeric vector of item positions (row numbers of `x`) to
#'   exclude from the analysis. Skipped items still contribute to the ability
#'   estimates, but their results (statistics, p-values, and moments) are set to
#'   `NA`, and they are never flagged or removed during purification. If `NULL`,
#'   all items are analyzed. Default is `NULL`.
#' @param alpha A numeric value specifying the significance level (\eqn{\alpha})
#'   of the tests. An item is flagged by a statistic when its p-value is less
#'   than or equal to `alpha`. The comparison uses unrounded p-values, although
#'   the p-values reported in `dif_stat` are rounded to four decimal places.
#'   Default is `0.05`.
#' @param missing  A value indicating missing responses in the data set. Default
#'   is `NA`.
#' @param purify Logical. Indicates whether to apply a purification procedure.
#'   Default is `FALSE`.
#' @param purify.by A character string specifying the RDIF statistic used for
#'   purification: "rdifrs" for \eqn{RDIF_{RS}}, "rdifr" for \eqn{RDIF_{R}}, or
#'   "rdifs" for \eqn{RDIF_{S}}. Used only when `purify = TRUE`. Default is
#'   `"rdifrs"`.
#' @param max.iter A positive integer specifying the maximum number of
#'   iterations allowed for the purification process. Default is `10`. Each
#'   iteration removes one item, so `max.iter` should be at least as large as
#'   the number of items expected to be flagged. If the limit is reached while
#'   flagged items remain, a warning is issued, the `complete` element of the
#'   purification results is `FALSE`, and the items flagged in the last
#'   iteration are added to the flagged items. This argument is not passed to
#'   [irtQ::est_score()].
#' @param min.resp A positive integer specifying the minimum number of item
#'   responses that an examinee must have to be used in the analysis. All
#'   responses of examinees with fewer than `min.resp` (but at least one)
#'   responses are set to `NA` before the ability estimation, in the initial
#'   analysis and at every purification iteration, also when `score` is
#'   supplied, and these examinees are excluded from the analysis. A warning
#'   reports the number of examinees excluded in the initial analysis. If
#'   `NULL`, no minimum is applied. Default is `NULL`. See **Details** for more
#'   information.
#' @param method A character string indicating the scoring method to use.
#'   Available options are:
#'   - `"ML"`: Maximum likelihood estimation
#'   - `"WL"`: Weighted likelihood estimation (Warm, 1989)
#'   - `"MAP"`: Maximum a posteriori estimation (Hambleton et al., 1991)
#'   - `"EAP"`: Expected a posteriori estimation (Bock & Mislevy, 1982)
#'
#'   Default is `"ML"`.
#' @param range A numeric vector of length two specifying the lower and upper
#'   bounds of the ability scale. This is used for the following scoring
#'   methods: `"ML"`, `"WL"`, and `"MAP"`. Default is `c(-5, 5)`.
#' @param norm.prior A numeric vector of length two specifying the mean and
#'   standard deviation of the normal prior distribution. These values are used
#'   to generate the Gaussian quadrature points and weights. Ignored if `method`
#'   is `"ML"` or `"WL"`. Default is `c(0, 1)`.
#' @param nquad An integer indicating the number of Gaussian quadrature points
#'   to be generated from the normal prior distribution. Used only when `method`
#'   is `"EAP"`. Ignored for `"ML"`, `"WL"`, and `"MAP"`. Default is 41.
#' @param weights A two-column matrix or data frame containing the quadrature
#'   points (in the first column) and their corresponding weights (in the second
#'   column) for the latent variable prior distribution. The weights and points
#'   can be conveniently generated using the function [irtQ::gen.weight()].
#'
#'   If `NULL` and `method = "EAP"`, default quadrature values are generated
#'   based on the `norm.prior` and `nquad` arguments. Ignored if `method` is
#'   `"ML"`, `"WL"`, or `"MAP"`.
#' @param ncore An integer specifying the number of logical CPU cores used by
#'   [irtQ::est_score()] when abilities are estimated internally. The test
#'   statistics themselves are not computed in parallel. Default is `1`.
#' @param verbose Logical. If `TRUE`, the progress of the purification procedure
#'   is printed to the console. Default is `TRUE`.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to [irtQ::est_score()] when abilities
#'   are estimated internally, for example `tol` or `se`. The `est_score()`
#'   arguments `max.iter` and `missing` cannot be passed this way, because the
#'   function uses arguments with these names for its own purposes.
#'
#' @details The RDIF framework (Lim & Choe, 2023; Lim et al., 2022) consists of
#'   three IRT residual-based statistics: \eqn{RDIF_{R}}, \eqn{RDIF_{S}}, and
#'   \eqn{RDIF_{RS}}. For each item, a residual is the observed item score minus
#'   the model-expected item score evaluated at the examinee's ability estimate.
#'   \eqn{RDIF_{R}} is the difference between the focal and reference groups in
#'   the mean raw residual, and \eqn{RDIF_{S}} is the difference in the mean
#'   squared residual. Under the null hypothesis that the item has no DIF,
#'   \eqn{RDIF_{R}} and \eqn{RDIF_{S}} asymptotically follow normal
#'   distributions whose means and variances are computed analytically from the
#'   model-predicted probabilities (Lim et al., 2022, Equations 9, 10, 12, and
#'   13). The null mean of \eqn{RDIF_{R}} is zero, whereas the null mean of
#'   \eqn{RDIF_{S}} is generally not zero. Each statistic is standardized by
#'   subtracting its null mean and dividing by its null standard deviation
#'   (`z.rdifr` and `z.rdifs`), and a two-sided p-value is obtained from the
#'   standard normal distribution. \eqn{RDIF_{RS}} is the quadratic form of the
#'   vector of \eqn{RDIF_{R}} and \eqn{RDIF_{S}}, centered at their null means,
#'   in the inverse of their null covariance matrix. Under the null hypothesis,
#'   \eqn{RDIF_{RS}} asymptotically follows a \eqn{\chi^{2}} distribution with 2
#'   degrees of freedom (Lim et al., 2022, Equation 20).
#'
#'   In rare cases, the covariance matrix of \eqn{RDIF_{R}} and \eqn{RDIF_{S}}
#'   is singular, for example when all examinees who responded to an item have
#'   the same probability of a correct response, so that \eqn{RDIF_{S}} is a
#'   linear function of \eqn{RDIF_{R}}. Then \eqn{RDIF_{RS}} is computed with the
#'   Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the covariance matrix and compared with
#'   a chi-square distribution whose degrees of freedom equal the rank of the
#'   matrix (Moore, 1977), and a warning names the item. This handling is not
#'   part of the original method (Lim et al., 2022) and is added in irtQ. In
#'   most data the matrix is not singular, and \eqn{RDIF_{RS}} has two degrees of
#'   freedom.
#'
#'   [irtQ::rdif()] accepts both dichotomous and polytomous items. For a
#'   polytomous item, the residual is the observed item score minus the
#'   model-expected item score, and the null means, variances, and covariance are
#'   computed from the model-predicted category probabilities in the same way,
#'   so the three statistics assess net DIF (Jung & Lim, 2026; Lim, Malatesta, &
#'   Lee, 2024). To evaluate global DIF in polytomous items, use
#'   [irtQ::crdif()].
#'
#'   To compute the RDIF statistics, the [irtQ::rdif()] function requires:
#'   (1) item parameter estimates obtained from aggregate data (regardless
#'   of group membership), (2) examinees' ability estimates (e.g., ML), and
#'   (3) examinees' item response data. Note that the ability estimates must
#'   be based on the aggregate-data item parameters. The item parameter estimates
#'   should be provided in the `x` argument, the ability estimates in the `score`
#'   argument, and the response data in the `data` argument. If ability
#'   estimates are not provided (i.e., `score = NULL`), [irtQ::rdif()] will
#'   estimate them automatically using the scoring method specified via the
#'   `method` argument (e.g., `method = "ML"`). When `x` is an object of class
#'   `est_irt`, the item parameter estimates, the response data, and the scaling
#'   constant `D` are taken from the object. When `x` is an object of class
#'   `est_item`, the ability values stored in the object are also used as
#'   `score`.
#'
#'   The `group` argument should be a vector containing exactly two distinct
#'   values (either numeric or character), representing the reference and focal
#'   groups, and the function stops when it contains more than two. Its length
#'   must match the number of rows in the response data, where each element
#'   corresponds to an examinee. Once `group` is specified, a single numeric or
#'   character value must be provided in the `focal.name` argument to indicate
#'   which level in `group` represents the focal group. Use [irtQ::grdif()] to
#'   compare more than two groups.
#'
#'   Examinees whose ability estimate is `NA`, such as examinees without any item
#'   response or examinees with `NA` in a supplied `score`, are excluded from the
#'   computation of the RDIF statistics. A warning reports the number of
#'   examinees with item responses who are excluded because of a missing value in
#'   `score`; these examinees stay excluded during purification. During
#'   purification, an examinee whose responses are all removed with the flagged
#'   items also has no ability estimate and is excluded, and one warning at the
#'   end reports the number of such examinees. The sample sizes `n.ref` and
#'   `n.foc` count only the examinees who are used.
#'
#'   If no examinee of one of the two groups responded to an item, the
#'   statistics and p-values of the item are `NaN`, and the item is not flagged.
#'
#'   Similar to other DIF detection approaches, the RDIF framework supports an
#'   iterative purification procedure (Lim et al., 2022). When `purify = TRUE`,
#'   the statistic specified in `purify.by` drives the procedure (e.g.,
#'   `purify.by = "rdifrs"`). At each iteration, the flagged item with the
#'   smallest p-value of the `purify.by` statistic is removed (the p-values are
#'   compared on the log scale), the abilities are re-estimated from the
#'   remaining items with the scoring method specified in `method`, and the RDIF
#'   statistics of the remaining items are recomputed. A supplied `score` is
#'   therefore used only in the initial analysis. The
#'   procedure stops when no remaining item is flagged or when `max.iter`
#'   iterations have been performed, where `max.iter` must be a single whole
#'   number of at least 1. If no item is flagged in the initial analysis, no
#'   iteration is performed. If every item is flagged, the procedure stops with
#'   a warning, because no item is left to estimate the abilities, and
#'   `complete` is `FALSE`.
#'
#'   Scoring based on a small number of item responses can lead to large
#'   standard errors, potentially reducing the accuracy of DIF detection in the
#'   RDIF framework. The `min.resp` argument excludes such examinees. For
#'   example, if `min.resp = 5`, examinees who responded to fewer than five items
#'   (but at least one) have all their responses treated as missing (i.e., `NA`)
#'   before the abilities are estimated, in the initial analysis and at every
#'   purification iteration. As a result, their ability estimates are missing,
#'   and they are not used in the computation of the RDIF statistics. When
#'   `score` is supplied, the scores of these examinees are also treated as
#'   missing in the initial analysis. During purification, the count is based on
#'   the items that remain after the flagged items are removed, and an examinee
#'   excluded once stays excluded. If `min.resp = NULL`, a score is computed for
#'   any examinee with at least one valid item response.
#'
#' @return This function returns an object of class `"rdif"`, which is a list
#' with the following five components:
#'
#' \item{no_purify}{A list of sub-objects containing the results of DIF analysis
#' without applying a purification procedure. The sub-objects include:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{dif_stat}{A data frame with one row per item and the columns `id`,
#'     `rdifr`, `z.rdifr`, `rdifs`, `z.rdifs`, `rdifrs`, `p.rdifr`, `p.rdifs`,
#'     `p.rdifrs`, `n.ref`, `n.foc`, and `n.total`: the item ID, the
#'     \eqn{RDIF_{R}} statistic and its standardized value, the \eqn{RDIF_{S}}
#'     statistic and its standardized value, the \eqn{RDIF_{RS}} statistic, the
#'     p-values of the three statistics (two-sided for \eqn{RDIF_{R}} and
#'     \eqn{RDIF_{S}}), the numbers of examinees in the reference and focal
#'     groups who responded to the item, and their sum. Statistics and p-values
#'     are rounded to four decimal places. \eqn{RDIF_{RS}} has no standardized
#'     value because it is a \eqn{\chi^{2}}-based statistic.}
#'     \item{moments}{A data frame with the columns `id`, `mu.rdifr`,
#'     `sigma.rdifr`, `mu.rdifs`, `sigma.rdifs`, and `covariance`: the item ID,
#'     the null mean and standard deviation of \eqn{RDIF_{R}}, the null mean and
#'     standard deviation of \eqn{RDIF_{S}}, and the null covariance between
#'     \eqn{RDIF_{R}} and \eqn{RDIF_{S}}. These moments are computed
#'     analytically under the null hypothesis of no DIF and are used to
#'     standardize the statistics.}
#'     \item{dif_item}{A list with the elements `rdifr`, `rdifs`, and `rdifrs`,
#'     each giving the positions (rows of `x`) of the items flagged by the
#'     corresponding statistic, or `NULL` if no item is flagged.}
#'     \item{score}{A numeric vector of the ability estimates used in the initial
#'     analysis: the supplied `score`, or the internal estimates when
#'     `score = NULL`.}
#'   }
#' }
#'
#' \item{purify}{A logical value indicating whether purification was requested
#' (the `purify` argument).}
#'
#' \item{with_purify}{A list with the results of the purification procedure. All
#' elements are `NULL` when `purify = FALSE`. The elements are:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{purify.by}{A character string indicating the RDIF statistic used for
#'     purification. Possible values are "rdifr", "rdifs", and "rdifrs",
#'     corresponding to \eqn{RDIF_{R}}, \eqn{RDIF_{S}}, and \eqn{RDIF_{RS}},
#'     respectively.}
#'     \item{dif_stat}{A data frame with the same columns as
#'     `no_purify$dif_stat` and an additional column `n.iter`. For an item
#'     removed during purification, the row reports the statistics from the
#'     iteration in which the item was removed, and `n.iter` is that iteration
#'     minus 1 (0 for an item removed on the basis of the initial analysis). For
#'     the other items, the row reports the statistics from the last iteration,
#'     and `n.iter` is the number of that iteration. If no item is flagged in the
#'     initial analysis, this is `no_purify$dif_stat` with `n.iter = 0`.}
#'     \item{moments}{A data frame with the same columns as
#'     `no_purify$moments` and an additional column `n.iter`, defined in the same
#'     way as in `dif_stat`.}
#'     \item{dif_item}{A numeric vector of the positions (rows of `x`) of the
#'     items flagged by the `purify.by` statistic, sorted in ascending order. It
#'     contains the items removed during purification and, if `max.iter` is
#'     reached, the items flagged in the last iteration. It contains all items
#'     if every item is flagged. `NULL` if no item is flagged in the initial
#'     analysis.}
#'     \item{n.iter}{The number of purification iterations performed (0 if no
#'     item is flagged in the initial analysis). The iteration that removes the
#'     last item is not counted, because the statistics are not recomputed.}
#'     \item{score}{A numeric vector of the ability estimates from the last
#'     iteration. `NULL` if no item is flagged in the initial analysis, because
#'     purification is not carried out; the initial estimates are then in
#'     `no_purify$score`.}
#'     \item{complete}{A logical value. `TRUE` if the procedure stopped because
#'     no remaining item was flagged (including the case in which no item is
#'     flagged in the initial analysis), and `FALSE` if it stopped because
#'     `max.iter` was reached or because every item was flagged.}
#'   }
#' }
#'
#' \item{alpha}{A numeric value indicating the significance level (\eqn{\alpha})
#' used for the tests.}
#'
#' \item{call}{The matched function call.}
