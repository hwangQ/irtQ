#' Residual-based Item Parameter Drift (RIPD) Detection Framework
#'
#' This function computes three RIPD statistics, \eqn{RIPD_{R}}, \eqn{RIPD_{S}},
#' and \eqn{RIPD_{RS}}, for each item. \eqn{RIPD_{R}} captures differences in
#' mean raw residuals between groups, which is typically indicative of uniform
#' item parameter drift (IPD). \eqn{RIPD_{S}} captures differences in mean
#' squared residuals between groups, reflecting nonuniform IPD. \eqn{RIPD_{RS}},
#' a combined chi-square-based index, is sensitive to both uniform and
#' nonuniform IPD.
#'
#' @inheritParams rdif
#' @param score A numeric vector of examinees' ability estimates (theta values)
#'   in the same row order as `data`. If `NULL`, the ability estimates are
#'   computed internally with [irtQ::est_score()] using `method`, `range`,
#'   `norm.prior`, `nquad`, `weights`, and `ncore`. When `purify = TRUE`, the
#'   ability estimates of all examinees in both groups are re-estimated
#'   internally at every purification iteration with these settings, so a
#'   supplied `score` is used only for the initial (non-purified) analysis. A
#'   missing value in `score` excludes the examinee from the analysis with a
#'   warning. Default is `NULL`.
#' @param group A numeric or character vector indicating the group membership of
#'   examinees. Its length must equal the number of rows in `data`. Examinees
#'   whose value equals `focal.name` form the focal group; all other examinees
#'   are pooled into the reference group (for example, the synthetic reference
#'   group described in Details).
#' @param item.skip A numeric vector of item positions (row numbers of `x`) to
#'   exclude from the IPD analysis. If `NULL`, all items are analyzed. Skipped
#'   items still contribute to the ability estimates; only their RIPD
#'   statistics and moments are set to `NA`, and they are never flagged. In CAT,
#'   this is typically used to skip low-exposure items (see Details). Default is
#'   `NULL`.
#' @param alpha A numeric value specifying the significance level (\eqn{\alpha})
#'   for hypothesis testing using the RIPD statistics. Default is `0.05`.
#' @param missing A value indicating missing values in the response data set.
#'   Default is NA.
#' @param purify.by A character string specifying which RIPD statistic is used
#'   to perform the purification. Available options are "ripdrs" for
#'   \eqn{RIPD_{RS}}, "ripdr" for \eqn{RIPD_{R}}, and "ripds" for
#'   \eqn{RIPD_{S}}. Used only when `purify = TRUE`. Default is `"ripdrs"`.
#' @param max.iter A positive integer specifying the maximum number of
#'   purification iterations. Default is 10. If the limit is reached while
#'   flagged items remain, a warning is issued, the items flagged at the last
#'   iteration are added to the flagged set, and the `complete` element of
#'   `with_purify` is `FALSE`. Because one item is removed per iteration,
#'   `max.iter` should be at least the number of items expected to drift (Lim &
#'   Han, 2026, used 80).
#' @param min.resp A positive integer specifying the minimum number of valid
#'   item responses required from a focal group examinee for the examinee's
#'   responses to be used. All responses of focal group examinees with fewer
#'   than `min.resp` (but at least one) responses are set to `NA` before the
#'   ability estimation, in the initial analysis and at every purification
#'   iteration, and these examinees are excluded from the analysis. A warning
#'   reports the number of examinees excluded in the initial analysis. Reference
#'   group examinees are not affected. If `NULL`, no minimum is applied. Default
#'   is `NULL`.
#'
#' @return This function returns an object of class `"ripd"`, a list with the
#' following elements:
#'
#' \item{no_purify}{A list of sub-objects containing the results of IPD analysis
#' without applying a purification procedure. The sub-objects include:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{ipd_stat}{A data frame of RIPD results for all items with the
#'     columns `id`, `ripdr`, `z.ripdr` (standardized \eqn{RIPD_{R}}), `ripds`,

#'     `p.ripdrs`, `n.ref`, `n.foc`, and `n.total`. `n.ref` and `n.foc` are the
#'     numbers of examinees in each group who responded to the item. Statistics
#'     and p-values are rounded to four decimal places and are `NA` for items in
#'     `item.skip`. \eqn{RIPD_{RS}} has no standardized value because it is a

#'     all items from the final iteration. Same columns as in \code{no_purify}
#'     plus `n.iter`. For a flagged item, `n.iter` is the iteration at which it

#'     \item{moments}{A data frame reporting the moments of RIPD statistics
#'     from the final iteration. Includes the same columns as in

#'     convergence, the items flagged at the last iteration are also included.
#'     \code{NULL} if no item is flagged in the initial analysis.}
#'     \item{n.iter}{An integer indicating the total number of iterations
#'     performed during the purification process.}
#'     \item{score}{A numeric vector of purified ability estimates used to
#'     compute the final RIPD statistics. \code{NULL} when no item is flagged in
#'     the first analysis, because purification is not carried out.}
#'     \item{complete}{A logical value indicating whether the purification
#'     process converged. If \code{FALSE}, the maximum number of iterations
#'     was reached without convergence.}

#'
#' \item{alpha}{A numeric value indicating the significance level (\eqn{\alpha})
#' used in hypothesis testing for RIPD statistics.}
#'
#' \item{call}{The matched function call.}
#'
#' @details
#' The current version supports dichotomous items only. The function stops if
#' `x` contains GRM or GPCM items or if `data` contain response values other
#' than 0 and 1.
#'
#' \strong{Theoretical Background: From RDIF to RIPD}
#'
#' The RIPD framework directly adapts the residual-based differential item
#' functioning (RDIF) detection framework (Lim et al., 2022; Lim & Choe, 2023)
#' to detect item parameter drift (IPD) in computerized adaptive testing (CAT).
#' Each RIPD statistic (\eqn{RIPD_R}, \eqn{RIPD_S}, \eqn{RIPD_{RS}}) mirrors
#' its RDIF counterpart (\eqn{RDIF_R}, \eqn{RDIF_S}, \eqn{RDIF_{RS}}) in both
#' computation and asymptotic theory, with two key adaptations. First, whereas
#' the original RDIF framework estimates item parameters once from the pooled
#' data of both groups, the RIPD framework uses the \emph{original,
#' pre-calibrated} item parameters from the CAT pool directly, eliminating the
#' need for item recalibration. Second, the reference group is a synthetic,
#' drift-free group simulated from the focal group's ability estimates (see
#' CAT-Specific Workflow). This makes RIPD practically scalable for operational
#' CAT programs, where the response data are sparse and recalibration is often
#' impractical.
#'
#' IPD in CAT can be viewed as a special case of DIF across time (Lord, 1980;
#' Veerkamp & Glas, 2000): the focal group represents current test-takers whose
#' responses may reflect drift, while the reference group represents a baseline
#' under invariant item parameters.
#'
#' \strong{Residual Definition}
#'
#' For examinee \eqn{i} and item \eqn{j}, the raw residual is defined as
#' \deqn{e_{ij} = u_{ij} - P_j(\hat{\theta}_i),}
#' where \eqn{u_{ij}} is the observed binary response (0 or 1) and
#' \eqn{P_j(\hat{\theta}_i)} is the model-predicted probability of a correct
#' response under the \emph{original} item parameters evaluated at the
#' examinee's ability estimate \eqn{\hat{\theta}_i}. Because item responses
#' are independent but not identically distributed (due to varying predicted
#' probabilities across examinees with different ability levels), the asymptotic
#' distributions of the RIPD statistics are established via Lyapunov's central
#' limit theorem. Below, \eqn{P_{ij} = P_j(\hat{\theta}_i)}, and \eqn{N_F} and
#' \eqn{N_R} denote the numbers of focal and reference group examinees who
#' responded to item \eqn{j}; all sums run over these examinees only.
#'
#' \strong{Three RIPD Statistics and Their Asymptotic Distributions}
#'
#' \emph{RIPD\eqn{_R}} (uniform drift): Measures the difference in mean raw
#' residuals between the focal (\eqn{F}) and reference (\eqn{R}) groups,
#' \deqn{RIPD_{R,j} = \frac{\sum_{i \in F} e_{ij}}{N_F} -
#'   \frac{\sum_{i \in R} e_{ij}}{N_R}.}
#' \eqn{RIPD_{R,j}} is most effective when the item response functions (IRFs)
#' of the two groups differ primarily in location (e.g., drift in the difficulty
#' \eqn{b} or guessing \eqn{c} parameter). Under the null hypothesis \eqn{H_0}
#' of no IPD, \eqn{RIPD_{R,j}} asymptotically follows a normal distribution
#' with mean zero and analytically derived variance
#' \eqn{\sigma^2_{RIPD_R} = \frac{\sum_{i \in F} P_{ij}(1 - P_{ij})}{N_F^2} +
#'   \frac{\sum_{i \in R} P_{ij}(1 - P_{ij})}{N_R^2}}.
#' A standard Z-test is then applied as \eqn{Z_R = RIPD_{R,j} / \sigma_{RIPD_R}}.
#'
#' \emph{RIPD\eqn{_S}} (nonuniform drift): Measures the difference in mean
#' squared residuals between groups,
#' \deqn{RIPD_{S,j} = \frac{\sum_{i \in F} e_{ij}^2}{N_F} -
#'   \frac{\sum_{i \in R} e_{ij}^2}{N_R}.}
#' \eqn{RIPD_{S,j}} captures drift that varies across the ability continuum,
#' such as a change in the discrimination parameter \eqn{a}, which
#' \eqn{RIPD_{R,j}} alone may not detect. Importantly, under \eqn{H_0}, the
#' null mean of \eqn{RIPD_{S,j}} is \strong{not zero} in general; it equals
#' \deqn{\mu_{RIPD_S} = \frac{\sum_{i \in F} P_{ij}(1 - P_{ij})}{N_F} -
#'   \frac{\sum_{i \in R} P_{ij}(1 - P_{ij})}{N_R},}
#' which depends on the predicted probabilities of the examinees in each group
#' who responded to item \eqn{j}. Even with a synthetic reference group, the
#' ability estimates and the administered items of the reference group differ
#' from those of the focal group, so this null mean is generally nonzero and is
#' computed item by item. The asymptotic variance is also analytically
#' derived. A standard Z-test is applied as
#' \eqn{Z_S = (RIPD_{S,j} - \mu_{RIPD_S}) / \sigma_{RIPD_S}}.
#'
#' \emph{RIPD\eqn{_{RS}}} (combined): A Wald-type statistic that jointly tests
#' for uniform and nonuniform drift within a single framework,
#' \deqn{RIPD_{RS,j} = (\boldsymbol{\nu}_j - \boldsymbol{\mu}_j)^\top
#'   \hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_j^{-1}
#'   (\boldsymbol{\nu}_j - \boldsymbol{\mu}_j),}
#' where \eqn{\boldsymbol{\nu}_j = (RIPD_{R,j},\ RIPD_{S,j})^\top},
#' \eqn{\boldsymbol{\mu}_j = (\mu_{RIPD_R},\ \mu_{RIPD_S})^\top} is the
#' vector of null means, and \eqn{\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_j} is the
#' analytically derived \eqn{2 \times 2} covariance matrix of
#' \eqn{(RIPD_{R,j}, RIPD_{S,j})}. Under \eqn{H_0}, \eqn{RIPD_{RS,j}}
#' asymptotically follows a \eqn{\chi^2} distribution with 2 degrees of
#' freedom. \eqn{RIPD_{RS}} is the \strong{recommended} statistic in practice
#' because it is sensitive to both uniform and nonuniform drift and addresses
#' potential inflation of the family-wise Type I error that arises from
#' applying \eqn{RIPD_R} and \eqn{RIPD_S} separately to the same item.
#'
#' In rare cases, the covariance matrix of \eqn{RIPD_R} and \eqn{RIPD_S} is
#' singular, for example when all examinees who responded to an item have the
#' same probability of a correct response, so that \eqn{RIPD_S} is a linear
#' function of \eqn{RIPD_R}. Then \eqn{RIPD_{RS}} is computed with the
#' Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the covariance matrix and compared with
#' a chi-square distribution whose degrees of freedom equal the rank of the
#' matrix (Moore, 1977), and a warning names the item. This handling is not part
#' of the original method (Lim et al., 2022; Lim & Han, 2026) and is added in
#' irtQ. In most data the matrix is not singular, and \eqn{RIPD_{RS}} has two
#' degrees of freedom.
#'
#' \strong{Diagnosing the Nature of Drift}
#'
#' The pattern of flagging across the three statistics can help diagnose the
#' type of drift. If an item is flagged by \eqn{RIPD_R} (and possibly
#' \eqn{RIPD_{RS}}) but not \eqn{RIPD_S}, uniform drift is indicated (e.g.,
#' difficulty shift). If flagged by \eqn{RIPD_S} (and possibly
#' \eqn{RIPD_{RS}}) but not \eqn{RIPD_R}, nonuniform drift is suggested (e.g.,
#' discrimination change). Items flagged by all statistics or by
#' \eqn{RIPD_{RS}} alone likely exhibit mixed drift.
#'
#' \strong{CAT-Specific Workflow}
#'
#' The RIPD procedure for CAT consists of three steps (Lim & Han, 2026):
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item \strong{Focal group CAT}: The current cohort of examinees takes the
#'     CAT using the operational (potentially drifted) item pool. Each examinee
#'     receives only a subset of items; the resulting response matrix is sparse.
#'     The final ability estimates \eqn{\hat{\theta}} (e.g., ML estimates) from
#'     this step are retained.
#'   \item \strong{Synthetic reference group construction}: The focal group's
#'     \eqn{\hat{\theta}} values are treated as true abilities. A CAT
#'     simulation with the same item pool and algorithm settings as in step 1 is
#'     run, generating item responses from the \emph{original} (pre-calibrated,
#'     drift-free) item parameters. This creates a synthetic reference group
#'     that matches the focal group's ability distribution, so that any
#'     systematic differences in residuals can be attributed to IPD rather than
#'     ability confounds. The reference group size is controlled by a
#'     replication factor: e.g., 1F reuses the focal \eqn{\hat{\theta}} values
#'     once (N_ref = N_foc), while kF replicates them k times. Larger reference
#'     groups reduce sampling variability in the reference residuals and improve
#'     detection power. In the simulation study of Lim and Han (2026), power
#'     gains diminished beyond 5F, and a reference group of at least 8 to 10
#'     times the focal group size (8F to 10F) was suggested as a practical
#'     guideline. Note that \code{ripd()} does not simulate the reference group;
#'     this step must be carried out with a CAT simulation program outside
#'     irtQ, and the simulated responses and ability estimates are then
#'     combined with the focal group data.
#'   \item \strong{RIPD computation with purification}: Residuals are computed
#'     for both groups using the original item parameters, and the three RIPD
#'     statistics are evaluated item-by-item. Items whose Z-test (for
#'     \eqn{RIPD_R} or \eqn{RIPD_S}) or chi-square test (for
#'     \eqn{RIPD_{RS}}) exceeds the critical value at level \code{alpha} are
#'     flagged as drifting.
#' }
#'
#' \strong{Purification Procedure}
#'
#' When \code{purify = TRUE}, an iterative purification procedure adapted from
#' Lim et al. (2022) is applied to mitigate the bias in ability estimates caused
#' by drifted items. This is analogous to the contaminating effect of DIF items
#' on matching variables. At each iteration:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item The item with the most statistically significant drift statistic
#'     (smallest p-value) among currently unflagged items is identified and
#'     flagged as a potential IPD item.
#'   \item Ability estimates of all examinees in both groups are recomputed with
#'     \code{\link{est_score}}, excluding all currently flagged items and using
#'     the \code{method}, \code{range}, \code{norm.prior}, \code{nquad},
#'     \code{weights}, and \code{ncore} arguments.
#'   \item RIPD statistics are recalculated using the updated ability estimates
#'     for the remaining items.
#' }
#' The process continues until no additional items are flagged (convergence) or
#' \code{max.iter} is reached. In the latter case, a warning is issued, the
#' items flagged at the last iteration are added to the flagged set, and
#' \code{complete} is set to \code{FALSE}. The function stops with an error when
#' all items are flagged, because no item is left to estimate the abilities.
#' The statistic used to drive purification is specified by \code{purify.by};
#' \code{"ripdrs"} (\eqn{RIPD_{RS}}) is recommended as it is sensitive to both
#' types of drift.
#'
#' \strong{Key Items and item.skip}
#'
#' In CAT contexts, many items in the pool receive few responses and thus lack
#' sufficient data for reliable IPD analysis. The \code{item.skip} argument
#' excludes such items (e.g., low-exposure non-key items) from the IPD tests.
#' Skipped items are still used to compute the ability estimates. In practice,
#' key items for RIPD evaluation are typically identified through a preliminary
#' CAT simulation as those with the highest average exposure frequencies under
#' the intended operational settings.
#'
#' \strong{Printing}
#'
#' The \code{print()} method of a \code{"ripd"} object shows the flagged items
#' and the RIPD statistics of the analyses without and with purification. Its
#' argument \code{what} selects \code{"no_purify"} or \code{"with_purify"}
#' (default \code{"all"}). Items without statistics (skipped items and items
#' without responses in a group) are not shown in the tables.

#' ## --- RIPD Example: Detecting IPD in CAT ---------------------------------
#' ##
#' ## Background (Lim & Han, 2026):
#' ##   In CAT-based IPD detection using RIPD, the reference group is
#' ##   "synthetic": it is created by re-administering a CAT to examinees whose
#' ##   true abilities are set equal to the focal group's ML theta estimates,
#' ##   using the ORIGINAL (pre-drift) item parameters. This eliminates the
#' ##   need for recalibration and makes RIPD directly applicable to
#' ##   operational CAT settings.
#' ##
#' ## The simIPD dataset contains:
#' ##   - foc_resp / foc_score : focal group CAT responses + ML theta estimates
#' ##                            (IPD items: a and b each drifted by -0.5)
#' ##   - ref_resp / ref_score : synthetic reference group CAT responses + ML
#' ##                            theta estimates (original parameters, 1F size)
#' ##   - item_par  : original (non-drifted) 360-item pool in irtQ format
#' ##   - key_item  : indices of 90 key items (highly exposed in CAT)
#' ##   - item.skip : indices of 270 non-key items (excluded from RIPD)
#' ##   - ipd_item  : indices of 18 truly drifted items (ground truth)
#' ## -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#'
#' data(simIPD)
#'
#' ## Step 1. Combine focal and synthetic reference group data
#' ##         (the row order does not matter as long as group matches the rows)
#' data  <- rbind(simIPD$ref_resp,  simIPD$foc_resp)
#' score <- c(simIPD$ref_score,     simIPD$foc_score)
#' group <- c(rep(0, nrow(simIPD$ref_resp)),   # 0 = reference
#'            rep(1, nrow(simIPD$foc_resp)))   # 1 = focal
#'
#' ## Step 2. Run RIPD with purification (recommended statistic: RIPD_RS)
#' ##         item.skip excludes the 270 non-key items from analysis
#' ripd_result <- ripd(
#'   x          = simIPD$item_par,
#'   data       = data,
#'   score      = score,
#'   group      = group,
#'   focal.name = 1,           # focal group is coded as 1
#'   item.skip  = simIPD$item.skip,
#'   D          = 1.7,
#'   alpha      = 0.05,
#'   purify     = TRUE,
#'   purify.by  = "ripdrs",    # purify using RIPD_RS (combined statistic)
#'   max.iter   = 30,
#'   method     = "ML",
#'   range      = c(-5, 5)
#' )
#'
#' ## Step 3. Review RIPD_RS results (with purification)
#' print(ripd_result, what = "with_purify")
#'
#' ## Step 4. Compare detected items to ground truth
#' detected <- ripd_result$with_purify$ipd_item
#' cat("Truly drifted items (ground truth):", simIPD$ipd_item, "\n")
#' cat("RIPD-detected items:               ", detected, "\n")
#' cat("True positives:", sum(detected %in% simIPD$ipd_item), "of",
#'     length(simIPD$ipd_item), "\n")
#'
#' ## -- Note on reference group size -----------------------------------------
#' ## This example uses a 1F reference group (n_ref = n_foc = 3,000).
#' ## In practice, a larger reference group improves detection power;
#' ## Lim and Han (2026) suggest at least 8F to 10F. To create, for example,
#' ## an 8F reference group, replicate the focal ability estimates and run
#' ## the same CAT simulation with the original item parameters using a CAT
#' ## simulation program (irtQ does not provide one):
#' ##
#' ##   theta_8F <- rep(simIPD$foc_score, times = 8)   # 24,000 examinees
#' ##   # simulate a CAT for theta_8F with simIPD$item_par, then call ripd()
#' ##   # with the simulated responses and final ability estimates
