#' Test-Level Reliability Summary (Cronbach's Alpha)
#'
#' Computes a test-level classical test theory (CTT) reliability summary
#' from scored item response data: Cronbach's alpha (raw and standardized
#' forms), the standard error of measurement (SEM), and the average item
#' difficulty and discrimination.
#'
#' @inheritParams ctt_item
#' @param correct Logical. Accepted for consistency with [ctt_item()] and
#'   [ctt()]. Both the raw and corrected mean item-total correlations are
#'   always reported and `ctt_alpha()` has no flagging step, so `correct`
#'   does not change the result.
#'
#' @details
#' Two forms of Cronbach's alpha are always computed and reported as separate
#' columns:
#'
#' Raw alpha (`alpha`) uses the standard variance-based formula,
#' `alpha = (k / (k - 1)) * (1 - sum(item variances) / total-score
#' variance)`, where k is the number of items. This formula is a general
#' reliability coefficient that applies unchanged to dichotomous and
#' polytomous item scores alike, and it reflects the reliability of the
#' unweighted total score obtained by summing the item scores, which is the
#' score most tests use for reporting and decisions.
#' In everyday terms, raw alpha asks: "if every item kept its own natural
#' scale and spread, how consistently do these items agree with each other?"
#'
#' Standardized alpha (`alpha_std`) is raw alpha computed after standardizing
#' every item with nonzero variance to unit variance. When no item is
#' constant, it equals `alpha_std = (k * r_bar) / (1 + (k - 1) * r_bar)`,
#' where `r_bar` is the average pairwise correlation among the items. A
#' constant item has no defined correlation and cannot be standardized, so it
#' stays in the item count k with zero variance, as in raw alpha, and `r_bar`
#' is the average correlation among the items that vary. `alpha_std` is `NA`
#' when it is undefined (fewer than two items vary, or the standardized total
#' score is constant). In everyday terms, standardized alpha asks: "if every
#' item counted equally regardless of how much it happens to vary in this
#' particular sample, how consistently would these items agree with each
#' other?" Because it removes the influence of any single item's variance,
#' standardized alpha is most
#' useful when items differ substantially in scale or format (e.g., a mix of
#' dichotomous and polytomous items with very different score ranges); when
#' all items share the same scale and format (as with a dichotomous
#' selected-response test scored 0/1), raw and standardized alpha are
#' typically close, and raw alpha remains the more directly interpretable of
#' the two since it matches the reliability of the score actually used in
#' practice. See Cronbach (1951) for the original derivation of coefficient
#' alpha, and Osburn (2000) for a discussion contrasting the raw
#' (covariance-based) and standardized (correlation-based) forms.
#'
#' The standard error of measurement (SEM) is computed as
#' `SEM = SD(total score) * sqrt(1 - alpha)` (using raw alpha), following the
#' standard CTT relationship between test reliability and measurement
#' precision.
#'
#' Average difficulty and average discrimination are the simple means of the
#' per-item values computed by [ctt_item()], ignoring `NA` values (e.g., the
#' discrimination of a constant item). As in [ctt_item()], the raw and
#' corrected item-total correlations are averaged separately and both are
#' reported. `ctt_alpha()` has no flagging step, so `correct` does not
#' change the result.
#'
#' Average difficulty depends on `cats`. When `cats` is not supplied, it is
#' inferred for each item as the observed maximum score plus one, with a
#' minimum of two, as in [ctt_item()]. An item that every examinee scores 0
#' on therefore enters the average with a difficulty of 0. For a polytomous
#' item whose highest score category is not observed in the sample, `cats`
#' is inferred too small and the item's difficulty is biased upward, so
#' supply `cats` explicitly whenever the maximum possible score may not have
#' been observed.
#'

#'   the counts are rounded to three decimal places.

#' \item{n_item}{number of items.}

#'   raw alpha computed after standardizing every item with nonzero variance
#'   to unit variance, with a constant item kept in the item count as in
#'   `alpha`; `NA` when it is undefined. It equals
#'   `k * r_bar / (1 + (k - 1) * r_bar)` when no item is constant. See
#'   **Details** for when it differs meaningfully from `alpha`.}
#' \item{sem}{the standard error of measurement (based on raw alpha); `NA`
