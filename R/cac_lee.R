#' Classification Accuracy and Consistency Using Lee's (2010) Approach
#'
#' This function computes classification accuracy and consistency indices for
#' complex assessments using the item response theory (IRT) approach of Lee
#' (2010). Tests may contain dichotomous items, polytomous items, or both.
#'
#' @param x A data frame containing item metadata (e.g., item parameters, number
#'   of categories, IRT model types, etc.). See [irtQ::est_irt()] or
#'   [irtQ::simdat()] for more details about the item metadata. This data frame
#'   can be easily created using the [irtQ::shape_df()] function.
#' @param cutscore A numeric vector of finite cut scores in strictly ascending
#'   order. The K - 1 cut scores divide examinees into K performance levels.
#'   With `cut.obs = TRUE`, the cut scores are on the observed summed score
#'   metric. With `cut.obs = FALSE`, they are on the ability (theta) metric. A
#'   score equal to a cut score is assigned to the higher level.
#' @param theta A numeric vector of ability estimates, one per examinee, used by
#'   the P method. It is ignored when `weights` is supplied. Missing values
#'   (`NA`) are excluded with a warning. Default is `NULL`.
#' @param weights A two-column data frame or matrix used by the D method. The
#'   first column holds the quadrature points (nodes), and the second column
#'   holds the corresponding weights, which should sum to 1; weights that do
#'   not sum to 1 are rescaled to sum to 1 with a warning (for example,
#'   frequencies can be given as weights). [irtQ::gen.weight()] creates such a
#'   data frame. When `weights` is supplied, `theta` is ignored. Default is
#'   `NULL`.
#' @param D A scaling constant used in IRT models to make the logistic function
#'   closely approximate the normal ogive function. A value of 1.702 is commonly
#'   used for this purpose. Default is 1.
#' @param cut.obs Logical. If `TRUE`, `cutscore` is on the observed summed score
#'   metric. If `FALSE`, `cutscore` is on the ability (theta) metric and is
#'   converted to the summed score metric with the test characteristic curve
#'   (TCC). Default is `TRUE`.
#'
#' @details
#' This function first validates the input arguments. If both `theta` and `weights`
#' are `NULL`, the function will stop and return an error message. Either `theta`
#' (a vector of ability estimates) or `weights` (a quadrature-based weight matrix)
#' must be specified.
#'
#' If `cut.obs = FALSE`, the provided cut scores are assumed to be on the theta (ability)
#' scale, and they are internally converted to the observed summed score scale using the
#' test characteristic curve (TCC). This transformation allows classification to be carried
#' out on the summed score metric, even if theta-based cut points are provided.
#'
#' For each ability value (a quadrature point in the D method, or an ability
#' estimate in the P method), the conditional distribution of the observed
#' summed score is computed with the Lord-Wingersky recursion (Lord &
#' Wingersky, 1984) and its extension to polytomous items (see
#' [irtQ::lwrc()]). Summing this distribution over the score ranges defined by
#' the cut scores gives the probability of being classified into each level. The
#' true level of an ability value is found by comparing its expected summed
#' score (the TCC value) with the same cut scores, so the observed cut scores
#' also serve as the true cut scores. The conditional classification accuracy is
#' the probability of being classified into the true level, and the conditional
#' classification consistency is the sum of the squared level probabilities,
#' which is the probability of the same classification on two independent
#' administrations (Lee, 2010).
#'
#' In the D method (`weights` supplied), the marginal indices are the weighted
#' sums of the conditional indices over the quadrature points. In the P method
#' (`theta` supplied), each examinee receives the weight 1/N, where N is the
#' number of ability estimates (after the missing values are excluded), so the
#' marginal indices are the averages of the conditional indices.
#'
#' @return A list with the following elements:
#'  - `confusion`: A K x K matrix of expected proportions, with the true levels
#'    in rows (dimension name `True`) and the expected (observed) levels in
#'    columns (dimension name `Expected`). The entries are rounded to 7 decimal
#'    places and sum to 1 when the weights sum to 1.
#'  - `marginal`: A data frame with the columns `level`, `accuracy`, and
#'    `consistency`. The rows for levels 1 to K give the contribution of the
#'    ability values whose true level is that level, that is, the weighted sums
#'    of their conditional indices. These rows add up to the last row,
#'    `marginal`, which holds the marginal classification accuracy and
#'    consistency.
#'  - `conditional`: A data frame with one row per ability value and the columns
#'    `theta`, `weights`, `true.score` (expected summed score), `level` (true
#'    level, a factor), `accuracy`, and `consistency`.
#'  - `prob.level`: A data frame with the columns `theta`, `weights`,
#'    `true.score`, and `level`, followed by `p.level.1` to `p.level.K`, the
#'    probabilities of being classified into each level.
#'  - `cutscore`: The cut scores used, on the observed summed score metric. When
#'    `cut.obs = FALSE`, these are the converted cut scores.
