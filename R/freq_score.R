#' Frequency Distribution Table for Total Scores
#'
#' Computes a frequency distribution table for a vector of total (raw)
#' scores: the frequency, percentage, and cumulative percentage of each score
#' value, as commonly reported with classical test theory (CTT) item
#' analysis results. [ctt()] calls this function to build the total-score
#' frequency distribution in its output, and it can also be used on its own
#' for any vector of integer total scores.
#'
#' @param score A numeric vector of integer total (raw) scores, one value per
#'   examinee.
#' @param missing A value indicating missing scores in `score`, analogous to
#'   the `missing` argument in [irtQ::est_irt()] and [irtQ::score_resp()]. Any
#'   element equal to `missing` is recoded to `NA` before tabulation. Default
#'   is `NA`. Examinees with a (remaining) missing score are excluded from
#'   the table, with a warning reporting how many were dropped.
#'
#' @details
#' The table includes every integer score value spanning the observed
#' minimum to maximum score (not just the values that were actually
#' observed), so that a score with zero examinees still appears in the table
#' with a frequency of 0, matching how a raw-score frequency table is
#' conventionally reported. Percentages are computed relative to the number
#' of non-missing scores and rounded to two decimal places; cumulative
#' percentages are the running sum of the unrounded percentages, rounded to
#' two decimal places only in the final output, so rounding error does not
#' accumulate and the last cumulative percentage is 100.
#'
#' This function requires integer scores, as is standard for a raw total
#' score. It does not bin or group values, and it stops with an error when a
#' score is not a whole number. A score within 1e-8 of a whole number, such as
#' the result of a floating-point sum, is counted as that whole number.
#'
#' The output table always spans `min(score)` to `max(score)`, so its size
#' scales with the observed score *range*, not the sample size; a single
#' unusually large or small outlier score will produce a correspondingly
#' large table.
#'
#' @return A data frame with one row per score value from `min(score)` to
#'   `max(score)`, containing:
#' \item{score}{the score value.}
#' \item{freq}{the number of examinees with that score.}
#' \item{pct}{the percentage of examinees with that score.}
#' \item{cum_pct}{the cumulative percentage up to and including that score.}
